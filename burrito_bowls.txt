1) Bring enough water to a boil to make one cup of rice or quinoa.
2) Add the rice or quinoa to the boiling water and cook until done
3) Cut up lots of vegetables. I typically recommend Jalepenos, Bell Pepper, Onions, and Lettuce. Sometimes tomato.
4) You can cook some of the vegetables in a skillet on the stove if you like
5) rinse a can of corn and a can of black beans
6) mix it all together in a bowl, top with salsa, and serve!
